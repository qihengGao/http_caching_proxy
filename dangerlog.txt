1. In the cache, we store our record in GMT time standard for computation convenience.
2. When test our GET method in http://www.columbia.edu/~fdc/sample.html,
 we cannot load the image at first, and we figure out that socket should be closed after the request is handled.
3. The messages received should be chekced if they are complete in bytes.
4. Our cache policy may have the drawback that could not clear any records as all the records are fresh.
We suggest that the policy could be replaced by more sophisticated way, such as LRU.

Exception Handling:

We cover the faileures during each steps of eatablishing a socket, connecting to a socket, sending and receiving messages.
We checked the status code of these operations, and whenever we find it is non-positive,
we would terminate current thread hadling this request and record the error in our log file.

Moreover, we also check if the request and response are in proper manner.

Our implementation would ensure a basic exception guarantee.
